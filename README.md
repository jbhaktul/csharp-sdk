# C# DOTNET CORE SDK Alpha

* [Website](https://www.moltin.com)
* [License](https://github.com/moltin/csharp-sdk/master/LICENSE)
* Version: dev

The Moltin csharp-sdk is an interface for the API to help you create an eCommerce ASP.NET web application.

## Installation
Reference the Moltin dotnet core package in your csproj file:

> `<PackageReference Include="Moltin" Version="*"/>`

The package is published via Nuget.


## Usage

The Samples folder has .NET Core projects. I am going to include a docker file in the publish folder of each probject so that anyone can run the application. The docker image will be the [official dotnet core running on Linux](https://store.docker.com/community/images/microsoft/dotnet).

/Samples/AspNet-Mvc<br/>
/Samples/Nancyfx - Note: Nancyfx dotnet core is still in beta (Nancy 2.0.0-clinteastwood)
